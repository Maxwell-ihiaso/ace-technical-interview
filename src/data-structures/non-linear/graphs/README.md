## Graphs 
A graph is an abstract data type that consists of a set of values related in a pair version.
These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

In a grapgh each item is called a node or a vertex
Nodes are then connected with edges


## Scenarios


### Types of Graphs
**Cyclic** vs **Acyclic**
**Directed** vs **Undirected**
**Weighted** vs **Unweighted**

### Graph Traversal

### BFS
### DFS
