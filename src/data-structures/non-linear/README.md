<h1 align='center'>Non-Linear Data Structures</h1>
- Elements are not alligned sequentially
- Elements cannot be accessed in a single run because they arranged in multiple levels
- They utilize system memory efficiently as compared to linear data structures
- Not easy for implementation
- Time complexity of non-linear data structures often remains the same no matter the size of the input

<h3>Advantages of non-linear data structures</h3>
1. Memory utilization is effective because there is no need to declare  memory in advance.

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
2. Not easy to implement.
