<h1>Linear Data Structures.</h1>
*These are data structures where elements are said to be arranged sequentially/linearly.
*Each and every element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.
*We can traverse all the elements in single run because there is only single level involved.
*Linear data structures are easier to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way.

<h3>Advantages of linear data structures</h3>
1. Easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way.

<h3>Disadvantages.</h3>
1.Memory utilization is ineffective because we have to declare the memory in advance while implementing.
