# Recursion
It's a technique in which a function repeatedly calls itself, until a specific condition is met and the function stops calling itself. This is achieved when a **[base case]()** is met.<br>It's a way of breaking down a problem into smaller, identical subproblems. <br>A function that calls itself is called a **recursive function** <br>

# A recursive function has three components:
* **The base** : which is the stopping point for the recursion
* **The reduction step** : which brings the inputcloser to the base case;
* **The recursive call** : where the function is invoked with the modified input

Example 1: 

**Factorial** 

```jsx
/**
 * Factorial
 * Time Complexity -> O(n)
 * Space Complexity -> O(n)
 */
const factorial = (num) => {
  //base case
  if (num === 2) return 2;
  //recursive case
  return num * factorial(num - 1);
};

console.log(factorial(10)); //3628800
```

The function **findFactorialRecursive** takes a single argument, 'n' and checks if it's equal to 2. If it is, the function returns 2. If not, the function return `n` multiplied by the factorial of `num - 1`. This is where the recursion happens - the function calls itself with the argument `num - 1`, and this process continues until the base case (`num === 1`) is reached. 


Example 2; 

**Fibonacci series/sequence**

```js
/**
 * fibonaci recursive
 * Time complexity -> O(2^n)
 * Space Complexity -> O(n)
 */
const fibonacci(num){
  //base case: if n is less than or equal to 2, return 1
  if(num <= 2){
    return 1;
  }
  //recursive case: n is greater than 2, so return the sum of the n-1th and n-2nd Fibonacci numbers
  else {
    return fibonacci(num-1) + fibonacci(num-2)
  }
}
console.log(fibonacci(10)); //55
```

In the above function, the base case is when `num` is less than or equal to 2. In this case, the function returns 1. This is the stopping point of the recursion. <br>
The **function** calls itself with argument `num - 1` and `num - 2`. This is where the recursion happens. The function continues to call itself until reaches the base case. The recursive calls keep returning values that get added together until `num` becomes less than or equal to 2. This is how the Fibonacci sequence is computed.


> To **note**: every recursive function needs a base case which is the point at which the recursion stops. Without it, the function will keep calling itself indefinitely, resulting in a stack overflow error. Recursion can be a powerful tool, bit it's important to use it judiciosly to avoid stack overflow errors.

### Rules of Recursion
1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. (Have two returns for the base case and the recursive case)
